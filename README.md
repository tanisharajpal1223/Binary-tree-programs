# Binary-tree-programs

hello welcome to my repo
today we are going to see two programs
both the programs are in python language

1) Binary tree using linked list:


This program is performing common operations on a Binary Search Tree (BST):

Insert:
Adds a new value to the tree such that:
Left child < parent
Right child > parent

Traversal Functions:
print_preorder: Root → Left → Right
print_inorder: Left → Root → Right
print_postorder: Left → Right → Root

Search:
Looks for a value in the BST and returns a pointer to the node if found.

Delete Tree:
Frees all dynamically allocated memory for nodes.


2) Binary search tree
